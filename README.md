* 🏫 I’m currently a first-year Computer Science student from down under, keen to learn as much as I can.
* 🌱 I’m currently learning
    * Python (intermediate-level knowledge)
    * C++ (Beginner's level)
    * Arduino hardware and software solutions (beginner's level)
    * SQL (Oracle SQLPlus) &ndash; intermediate level
* 👨 I’m looking to collaborate on software development projects &ndash; whether open-source or otherwise &ndash; in Python or C++.
* 🤔 I am very willing to learn new languages and libraries
* 💬 Ask me anything...
